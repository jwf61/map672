<h1>My Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h1>
<p>I would describe myself as a cartographer along the Coder-Cartographer-Critic Spectrum. When producing a map, I still give thought to choosing the right classification to display geographic phenomena in a meaningful way. There is significance to what color scheme I use, besides just aesthetics, that is important. While seeing myself as a cartographer, at the same time I feel as though there are many forces pushing cartographers towards the Coder end of the spectrum. I think the main reasons for this are the changes that occurred starting with the launch of Google Maps in 2005, which gave a different expectation to map readers. Map readers, who are not exposed to the cartographic methods are so used to seeing maps throughout their daily lives, whether checking in on the 2016 Presidential Election or browsing through Facebook and seeing a nationwide map of proximity to Starbucks. Many of these maps have been made fairly quickly, not necessarily using sound cartographic techniques. These maps are also very enjoyable to look at and interact with. That truly is the key: you can do more than just “look” due to recent developments in the web mapping industry. Just like an entertainment performer “plays to their audience,” there is the same type of pressure in today's mapping umbrella to give the map readers what they want: geographic displays which are interactive, have interesting titles and color schemes that jump off the page.

<p>I found manifesto point #5 to be the most provocative of the six. I think it must be quite rare for one to produce a map with the intention of taking misfortune towards a certain community, but whether intentional or not, certain maps can be detrimental. For instance, mapping poverty in U.S. cities can be helpful in many ways. Government departments and NGO's can provide resources that would be beneficial to these impoverished areas with the help of these maps. On the other hand, if someone who owned a “payday” loan business got a hold of the same map, that could potentially identify suitable areas for a new payday loan store to pop up. Payday loans only encourage existing poverty; therefore, this same map could be detrimental. 
</p>
<p>I envision my mapping career moving more into the coding/programming world while still keeping cartographic integrity. Obviously, there are plenty of individuals who are already successfully meshing these two sides of the spectrum together, and I hope to be one of them at some point. I would also like to move out of simple data creation and editing role into a position which enables me to do more analysis.
