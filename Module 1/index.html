<h1>My Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h1>
<p>I would describe myself as a cartographer along the Coder-Cartographer-Critic<br> Spectrum. When producing a map, I still give thought to choosing the right<br> classification to display geographic phenomena in a meaningful way. There is<br> significance to what color scheme is used, besides just aesthetics, that I know is quite<br> important. While definitely seeing myself as a cartographer, at the same time,<br> I feel as though there are many forces pushing cartographers towards the Coder end<br> of the spectrum. I think the main reason for this are the changes that were<br> brought about, starting with the launch of Google Maps in 2005, which gave a different<br> expectation to map readers. Map readers, who have not been exposed to the<br> cartographic methods are so used to seeing maps throughout their daily lives,<br> whether checking in on the 2016 Presidential Election or browsing through Facebook<br> and seeing a nationwide map of proximity to Starbucks. Many of these maps have been made fairly quickly, not necessarily using sound cartographic techniques. These maps are also very enjoyable to look at and interact with. That truly is the key, you can do more than just “look” due to recent developments in the web mapping industry. Just like a entertainment performer “plays to their audience”, there is the same type of pressure in today's mapping umbrella to give the map readers what they want: geographic displays which are interactive, have interesting titles and color schemes that jump off the page.

I found manifest point #5 to be the most provocative of the six. I think it must be quite rare for one to produce a map with the intention of taking misfortune towards a certain community, but whether intentional or not, certain maps can be detrimental. For instance, mapping poverty in U.S. cities can be helpful in many ways. Government departments and NGO's can provide resources that would be beneficial to these impoverished areas with the help from this maps. On the other hand, if someone who owned an “payday” loan business got a hold of the same map, that could potentially identify suitable areas for a new payday loan store to pop up. Payday loans only encourage existing poverty, therefore this map could be detrimental. 
	I envision my mapping career moving more into the coding/programming world while still keeping cartographic integrity. Obviously, there are plenty of individuals who are already successfully meshing these two sides of the spectrum together and I hope to be one of them at some point. I would also like to move out of simple data creation and editing role into a role which enables more analysis to be used.
